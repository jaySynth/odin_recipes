        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Boiling water</li>
                <li>Loose tea or tea bag</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether you use loose tear or tea bags, the prepartion method is the same. Start with a
                    spotlessly clean teapot made of glass, china or earthenware. Add rapidly boiling water,
                    and allow to stand a few minutes to "hot the pot." Pour out just before brewing the tea.
                </li>
                <li>Heat cold water to a full roiling boil. (use water from the cold-water tap; water from the
                    hot-water tap may contain mineral deposits from water pipes that can affect the flavor of the tea.)
                </li>
                <li>Add tea to the warm pot, allowing 1 teaspoon of loose tea or 1 tea bag for each cup of tea.
                    Pour boiling water over tea (3/4 cup for each cup of tea); let stand 3 to 5 minutes to bring out
                    the full flavor. Stir tea once to ensure uniform strength. Do not judge the strength of tea by its color;
                    you must taste it. Strain the tea, or remove tea bags. Serve with sugar and milk or lemon if desired.
                </li>
            </ol>
